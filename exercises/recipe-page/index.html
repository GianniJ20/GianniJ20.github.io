                1/2 teaspoon salt

        </ul>
    
    <h4>BANG BANG SAUCE<h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                1/2 cup mayonnaise
            <li>
                1/2 cup sweet chili sauce
            <li>
                1 teaspoon minced garlic
            <li>
                1 tablespoon rice vinegar
            <li>
                1 tablespoon sriracha, more to taste
            <li>
                1/2 tablespoon fresh parsley, finely chopped
            <li>
                1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, optional for more spice
       </ul>  

    <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
       
       <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the air fryer or oven to 450°F.

            <li>
                In a small bowl, make the bang bang sauce. Combine mayonnaise, 
                sweet chili sauce, garlic, rice vinegar, sriracha, and parsley 
                until smooth. Set aside.
            <li>
                To a bowl, add the chopped chicken along with soy sauce, olive 
                oil,oyster sauce, garlic, ginger, chili powder, smoked paprika, 
                onion powder, salt, black pepper, and light brown sugar. 
                Mix together and if you have the time, let it marinate 
                for 30 minutes.
            <li>
                After marinating, thread the chicken pieces onto skewers. 
                If using wooden skewers, make sure they have soaked in water 
                for 30 minutes to prevent them from burning. I like to add 
                about 6 to 7 pieces onto each skewer.
            <li>
                Add the skewers to the air fryer and air fry for about 
                13 to 15 minutes at 450°F until fully cooked and charred.
            <li>
                Drizzle bang bang sauce on top and add green onions to enjoy.
