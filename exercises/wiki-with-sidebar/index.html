                <p>
                    Poppy Playtime is an episodic survival horror video game 
                    series first developed and published in 2021 by American 
                    indie developer Mob Entertainment. The game is set in 
                    the fictional toy-making company named Playtime Co. The 
                    player controls an unnamed protagonist, a retired employee 
                    who receives a note inviting them back to the abandoned toy 
                    factory after the company's staff mysteriously disappeared. 
                    In the game, the player navigates through a first-person 
                    perspective and must solve puzzles, such as requiring a 
                    gadget named the GrabPack, to progress while avoiding 
                    various monsters in the factory

                    The first three chapters of Poppy Playtime garnered positive 
                    reviews for their horror, gameplay, story and animation, 
                    although they were criticized for their numerous bugs, 
                    particularly in the second chapter. The game faced several 
                    controversies, mainly due to its aesthetics and character 
                    design's similarities to that of children-oriented media 
                    resulting in popularity among younger-than-intended 
                    demographics. The announcement of in-game non-fungible 
                    token content in December 2021 received harsh criticism, 
                    resulting in the developers reversing all profits from the 
                    tokens to charity.

                <p>
                    In the year 2005, a former employee of a toy production 
                    company named Playtime Co. receives a package containing a 
                    note and a VHS tape advertising the company's Poppy Playtime 
                    oll and tours of their toy factory before abruptly cutting 
                    to spliced-in footage of graffiti of a poppy and a letter 
                    from the missing staff, requesting them to 
                    "find the flower". After watching the tape, the employee 
                    complies and returns to the toy factory to do so.
                    Arriving at the now-abandoned factory, the employee acquires 
                    a one-handed GrabPack to access the lobby. There, they 
                    encounter Huggy Wuggy, a seemingly giant statue toy on 
                    display in the room's center. While trying to unlock another 
                    door, the power goes out. Though the employee restores it, 
                    they find that the Huggy statue has disappeared. Upon 
                    obtaining a second hand for their GrabPack, they use a 
                    conveyor belt to reach the factory's "Make-a-Friend" 
                    section, where they manufacture a toy to progress further. 
                    Suddenly, a monstrous Huggy appears and chases them into the 
                    vents before they send him falling to his death to the 
                    bottom of the factory. Soon enough, the employee finds the 
                    graffiti, which leads to a room containing a Poppy Playtime 
                    doll inside a glass case. After unlocking the case, Poppy 
                    acknowledges them before the employee passes out.

                <p>
                    Upon awakening, the employee finds Poppy gone and explores 
                    the factory's rear halls before eventually locating Playtime 
                    founder Elliot Ludwig's office. There, they re-encounter
                    Poppy, who thanks them for freeing her and offers to help 
                    them escape by providing the activation code for the 
                    factory's train. However, she is grabbed and pulled deeper 
                    into the factory. As the employee approaches the Game 
                    Station and the train, they encounter a giant spider-like 
                    monster called Mommy Long Legs, who steals a hand from 
                    their GrabPack, reveals she is holding Poppy hostage, and 
                    challenges the employee to win three games in the Game 
                    Station in exchange for the train's code, threatening to 
                    kill them if they break the rules. After locating and 
                    crafting a new hand for their GrabPack, the employee p
                    roceeds through the Game Station. They successfully
                    complete the first two games, obtain two-thirds of the 
                    train code, and briefly encounter a friendly female 
                    version of Huggy called Kissy Missy before they are forced
                    to escape into subterranean tunnels during the third game 
                    upon realizing that Mommy rigged it to ensure their demise. 
                    An enraged Mommy accuses them of cheating and pursues them 
                    back into the factory until they trap her in an industrial 
                    grinder and activate it, killing her. A needle-fingered 
                    hand, later revealed to belong to an experiment called the 
                    "Prototype", subsequently collects her body. The employee 
                    rescues Poppy, obtains the third part of the train code, 
                    and nearly escapes. However, Poppy diverts the train, 
                    refusing to let them leave as she requires their help. 
                    Before she can explain further, the train runs out of 
                    control and derails near a sign pointing to "Playcare", 
                    knocking the employee unconscious.

                    Following the train derailment, the employee reawakens as a 
                    giant cat-like monster called CatNap throws them into a 
                    trash compactor, but they escape and head to Playtime's 
                    on-site orphanage, Playcare. Along the way, they find a toy 
                    phone and receive advice from a voice referring to himself 
                    as "Ollie", who warns them that CatNap, Playcare's guardian 
                    and a recalled member of Playtime's "Smiling Critters" line, 
                    will try and kill them. On Ollie's instructions, the 
                    employee attempts to reroute power from Playcare's many 
                    facilities to power the Gas Production Zone and divert a 
                    hallucinogenic gas called the "Red Smoke", which CatNap 
                    can produce. All throughout, they obtain the GrabPack 2.0, 
                    re-encounter Kissy, and reunite with Poppy, who explains 
                    she needs their help to kill the Prototype and end its 
                    control over the factory. After killing a hostile teacher 
                    named Miss Delight, the employee eventually encounters the 
                    last Smiling Critter, DogDay, who warns them that CatNap 
                    worships the Prototype like a god and mutilated him for 
                    defying it before he is killed and possessed by several 
                    Mini Smiling Critters, who mount a failed attempt at 
                    killing the employee. Following an attack by CatNap, 
                    the employee experiences a hallucination wherein Poppy 
                    asks about their knowledge of Playtime experimenting on 
                    children and turning them into the monsters they have 
                    encountered. The employee eventually defeats CatNap before 
                    the Prototype kills him and takes his body. After 
                    successfully redirecting the Red Smoke, Poppy reveals to the
                    employee footage of the "Hour of Joy", wherein the 
                    Prototype ordered Playtime's monsters to kill the 
                    employees indiscriminately ten years prior. Reiterating 
                    their mission to kill the Prototype, Poppy leads the 
                    employee onto a lift to make their descent towards the 
                    Prototype's lair, intending to send it back up for Kissy. 
                    On the way down however, Poppy hears something attack 
                    Kissy and frantically attempts to send the lift back up, 
                    but the hatch closes on her and the employee.
